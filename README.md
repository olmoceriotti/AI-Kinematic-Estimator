# AI Kinematic Estimator

In this notebook I created some AI models to compute the position of the end effector of some different robot arms. The datasets were generated using Gymnasium and MUJOCO. 
I also created a model to estimate the inverse kinematic of a robot arm given the end effector position, with variyng results depending on the robot in focus.
